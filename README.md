STAT 184 Course Project

Education Change Over Recent Decades
This repository tracks how education in the U.S. has changed over recent decades, including trends in college costs and graduation rates. It provides data and analysis to help understand patterns in access, affordability, and student success.

Overview
The project explores how tuition and fees have grown over time, compares these trends across states, and examines how they relate to graduation outcomes.

Interesting Insight
One notable finding is that while tuition costs have increased in nearly every state, graduation rates have not grown at the same pace, highlighting disparities in affordability versus completion.

Current Plan
We will use R Studio to read, clean, and wrangle the data, then conduct exploratory data analysis and create multiple visualizations to highlight trends in costs and graduation rates. A reproducible PDF report will be prepared using a QMD file with narrative, captions, and a code appendix. The project will be managed on GitHub with proper branching, commits, and pull requests to track changes and ensure collaboration.
