# Introduction

Education is a global asset that promotes potential, learning, reasoning, empathy, and understanding of the world. This is the process gaining of knowledge, skills, values, and building character. Over the past decades, there have been major transformation of tuition costs, graduation rates, and years to graduate. These changes have influenced how students learn, institutions operate, and how society's understanding of education has changed. Tuition costs have been skyrocketing, which prompt discussion of higher education, affordability, and equity. Redefining educational access, flexibility, and skills for academic success.

This project is going to explore different variable correlations on education.

1.  Key factors

    1.  Graduation rates,

    2.  Tuition costs,

    3.  Years spent,

    4.  Year taken,

    5.  State.

Investigating these questions to illuminate patterns of structures and economy. Obtaining insights to understand the long-term changes of educational progress and challenges.

# Data Provenance

This project uses two datasets for the key factors that we looked into for education. These datasets were taken from reliable online sources on Kaggle for analysis.

### College Completion Dataset

Source: Kaggle

Description: The dataset contains data on student, success, graduation rates, race, and gender demographics. Measure to compare colleges across states and more. Source of information to help better understand college completion and student success in the United States.

Purpose: Exploring trends in college completion

Case: Each case in the dataset corresponds to a student and state respectively

### Average Cost of Tuition Dataset

Source: Kaggle

Description: Constructed using data from the National Center for Education Statistics Annual Digest. Average undergaduate tuition and fees, charged to full-time students at degree-granting postsecondary institutions. By level of institution, state.

Purpose: Analyze the average cost of undergrad students by state in the US

Case: Each case in the dataset corresponds to a student and state respectively

# Data Wrangling

In the College Completion dataset, data columns were removed based on the relevance to our research questions.

In the Average Cost of Tuition dataset, data rows were removed based on the data required for the research questions.

# FAIR Principles

### Findable:

Both datasets are hosted publicly on Kaggle with clear titles, descriptions, and metadata, making them easy to locate.

### Accessible:

The datasets can be downloaded by standard HTTP(s) protocols, and metadata remains accessible even if the dataset changes.

### Interoperable:

Data is provided in standard CSV format with commonly used variable definitions, allowing integration with other datasets and tools.

### Reusable:

The data can be reused because it has a clear license and information about where it came from.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

### Figure 1 Visualization

This visualization shows how average undergraduate tuition costs have changed from 2013 to 2021.

The line increases over the entire period, showing that tuition prices rise consistently year after year.

From 2013 to 2020, the increase is gradual but steady, and this suggests a predictable upward trend caused by factors like inflation and rising education costs.

This table shows the wide range of tuition costs in the dataset. The mean tuition is about \$13,027.72, but the median is lower at \$10,203.50, suggesting that most schools charge less than the average. The large gap between the minimum (\$1,225) and maximum (\$49,152) shows a lot of variation between institutions, with a few very expensive schools pulling the average upward. Overall, these statistics highlight that tuition costs are unevenly distributed and vary greatly across different colleges.

### Key Insights

-   Tuition costs have risen constantly.

-   The upward trend of tuition increase can introduce additional factors that can be explored.

### Figure 2 Visualization

This bar chart shows the total number of college graduates by state.

Larger states like California, New York, and Texas have the biggest graduate cohorts

Smaller states like Alaska, Wyoming, and Vermont have far fewer graduates.

![](images/Screenshot 2025-12-09 192851.png)

### Key Insights

-   States with higher population density have a higher graduation cohort.

-   These states have more post secondary school attending population

### Figure 3 Visualization

The visualization emphasizes the significant differences in graduate numbers across states, which reflects differences in population size, number of colleges, and higher education enrollment.

The graduation rates for the ten largest U.S. states by student cohort size showed mixed results

The top two remained pretty constant throughout the 10 year period.

California and Florida experienced a lot of variation.

Most of the rest of the states stayed constant as well.

Texas, while ranking on the lower end, actually had a big increase in graduate rates.

### Key Insights

-   Overall, there is a steady graduation rate throughout the span over this decade. However, there are several states that have substantial increase and decreases that can be explored further.

# Conclusion:

From our findings, we found that the price of college tuition has been steadily increasing and continues to rise.

Tuition costs vary widely across colleges, with most schools charging below the average of \$13,027.72 and a few expensive outliers driving up the mean.

We took a look at college completion rates and the top three states were California, New York, and Pennsylvania.

We also analyzed college completion rates for the top 10 states over time and got mixed results. Some rates went up, some went down, and some stayed the same.

Overall, these findings suggest that while tuition continues to rise and varies greatly across institutions, college completion rates show diverse trends across states, highlighting the complex relationship between cost and educational outcomes.
